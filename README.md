Ideas for Data Exploration

Hello World!
My name is Auralee, AKA Aura. I'm a data scientist with a big interest in music. 
I would like to start creating more data visualizations about music-related data. 
For my first project, I plan to manipulate some data frames in R, create visualizations with plotly, and embed them on my website.

Ideas / things I want to explore:
1. Geography of music in the US - by band origin or record label location?
2. Data mining music characteristics with the million song dataset
3. Musical genre changes in what's popular in conjunction with political movements
4. Integration of electricity into music making / tech advancements over time

Let's see where this goes!
